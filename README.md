# react-sombrero
A full web frontend framework based on react, redux-immutable, redux-saga and webpack

## Why

- React is great, but it's "just" a web view library.
- Boilerplates are useful, but you have to take them as they are, you don't have any control or any tool to add components automatically, for instance.

With this framework, we put every best practices we learnt in the last few years to create a full CLI based program that helps you init a project without worrying about webpack dev or production config, folders scenes and components structure, routing, etc. Just as Angular does.

We know that every project has their own requirements, so this tool can be an overkill for small projects, or too much restrictive for big ones, but it can be really useful for demos or MVPs.    

## TODOs

- ~~Make package CLI based~~
- Commands:
    - init
    - help
- Routing system
- Forms management
- Tests
